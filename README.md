## Problem Definition 
Dentralized social media platforms have been
criticized for their inability to effectively combat the spread of false or misleading information,
which can have serious consequences. This problem is compounded by the fact that these
platforms often prioritize engagement and revenue over the accuracy of the information being
shared.

## Objective:
- The main objective of this project is to envision a future where social media is
decentralized, transparent, and secure, and to explore the potential of the Solana
blockchain in making this a reality.
- **Increase user engagement and retention on the platform:** By reimagining Facebook as
a web 3.0 platform, the project aims to make the platform more appealing and relevant to
users, encouraging them to continue using the platform and stay engaged with its
features.
- **Improve security and privacy:** By using blockchain technology and blockchain wallets,
the project aims to enhance the security and privacy of the platform, potentially
addressing some of the concerns that have led to the decline in Facebook usage.
- **Attract new users:** By implementing innovative features such as non-fungible token
sharing, the project aims to attract new users who may not have previously been
interested in Facebook or who may have been attracted to alternative social media
platforms.
- **Monetize the platform:** By charging a fee for each post, the project aims to generate
revenue for the company, potentially offsetting any costs associated with the transition to
web 3.0.
- **Foster a sense of community:** By allowing users to share non-fungible tokens, the
project aims to create a sense of community and connection among users, potentially
enhancing their overall experience.

## Proposed System:
**Next.js**: Next.js is a popular JavaScript framework for building server-rendered or statically-
exported React applications. It is built on top of React and web pack, and enables developers to
build scalable and performant web applications with minimal configuration.
Here are some basic Next.js commands used in our project:
1. npx create-next-app - This command creates a new Next.js app in a new directory.
2. npm run dev - This command starts the development server for the Next.js app.
3. npm run build - This command builds the Next.js app for production.
4. npm run start - This command starts the production server for the Next.js app.
5. next/css - This module allows you to import and use CSS files in your Next.js app.
Overall, Next.js is a powerful and easy-to-use framework that simplifies the development of
server-rendered and statically-exported React apps. It provides a wide range of features and tools
that make it easy to build fast and scalable web applications.
- **Rust Language**: Rust is a programming language that was designed to be fast, safe, and
concurrent. It was developed by Mozilla and released in 2010.
One of the main features of Rust is its strong emphasis on safety. It has a type system that is
statically-typed and borrow-checked, which helps prevent common programming errors such as
null or dangling pointer references. Rust also has a low-level control over system resources,
which makes it well-suited for systems programming tasks such as operating systems, file
systems, and network servers.
In addition to its safety features, Rust is also known for its performance. It has a compiled
language that is designed to produce efficient machine code, and it has a number of features that
enable fine-grained control over how code is executed.
Rust has a growing community of developers and is used in a variety of industries, including
web development, game development, and embedded systems. It has a number of popular
libraries and tools, such as the Rust compiler (cargo) and the Rust package manager (crates.io).
- **Solana Network**: Solana is a decentralized network and blockchain platform that is designed to
support high-throughput and low-latency transactions. It was developed by Solana Labs and
launched in 2020.
One of the main features of Solana is its high scalability. It uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus
mechanism and a unique architecture called "Proof of History" to enable fast and efficient
transactions. Solana claims to be able to process over 65,000 transactions per second, making it
one of the fastest blockchain platforms currently available.
Solana is also designed to be developer-friendly, with a focus on providing a robust ecosystem of
tools and resources for building decentralized applications (dApps). It has a programming
language called "Move" that is specifically designed for building smart contracts, and it also
supports popular languages such as Rust.
Solana is used in a variety of applications, supply chain management, gaming, and more. It has a
growing community of developers and users, and its native cryptocurrency, SOL, is listed on a
number of popular exchanges.
- **Solana Faucet:** A Solana faucet is a website or service that provides users with small amounts of
the Solana cryptocurrency (SOL) for free. Faucets are typically used as a way for users to get
started with a cryptocurrency and try out the Solana platform, or to test out applications and
smart contracts that are built on Solana.
To use a Solana faucet, users typically need to provide their Solana wallet address and complete
a simple task, such as solving a captcha or answering a question. The faucet will then send a
small amount of SOL to the user's wallet. The amount of SOL that a faucet provides may vary,
but it is usually a very small amount, such as a few hundredths or thousandths of a SOL.
Solana faucets are usually funded by donations or advertising revenue, and they may have limits
on the number of times a user can claim SOL in a given period. Some faucets may also require
users to complete additional tasks or participate in social media activities in order to claim SOL.
Solana faucets can be a useful way for users to get started with the Solana platform, but they
should not be relied upon as a primary source of income or as a way to acquire significant
amounts of SOL.
- **Anchor:** Anchor is a tool that aims to make it easier to work with Rust, a programming language
known for its strong emphasis on safety and performance. Anchor provides a number of features
that are designed to streamline the development process and make it easier to build Rust
applications.
One of the main features of Anchor is its support for rapid prototyping and testing. It includes a
number of utilities and libraries that allow developers to quickly set up and run Rust code,
without having to manually configure a development environment or build toolchain.
anchor also provides a number of resources and documentation for learning Rust, including
tutorials, examples, and API documentation. It has a large and active community of users who
contribute to the project and provide support and guidance to new users.
Overall, anchor is a useful tool for anyone looking to get started with Rust or to streamline their
Rust development workflow. It provides a number of features and resources that make it easier to
build and deploy Rust applications.
- **Transaction Fee:** In the context of the Solana blockchain, GAS is not used as a unit of
measurement for the cost of executing transactions or smart contracts. Instead, Solana uses a
different model for fees and incentives called "Transaction Fees."
In Solana, transaction fees are paid in the native cryptocurrency, SOL, and are used to incentivize
validators to process and validate transactions on the network. The amount of transaction fees
required for a given transaction is determined by the size of the transaction in bytes, as well as
the current demand for SOL on the network.
In general, larger and more complex transactions will require more transaction fees, while
smaller and simpler transactions will require less. The exact amount of transaction fees required
will depend on a variety of factors, including the size of the transaction, the current demand for
SOL on the network, and the overall health of the Solana ecosystem. 
If a user submits a transaction that requires two SOL in transaction fees, this means that the
transaction is relatively large or complex and requires a significant amount of resources to
process and validate. The user will need to have at least two SOL in their account balance in
order to pay for the transaction fees and have their transaction processed by the network.
Overall, the use of transaction fees in Solana is a key aspect of the network's design and helps to
ensure that transactions are processed efficiently and that the network remains secure and
decentralized.
- **Sanity.io:** Sanity.io is a content management platform that is designed to help teams create and
manage structured content for their websites and applications. It is not specifically designed for
managing a Solana network, but it could potentially be used in conjunction with a Solana-based
application to manage content for the application.
One of the main features of Sanity.io is its flexible and customizable data model, which allows
teams to define their own content types and structures, and to create custom fields and schemas
to suit their specific needs. This feature could be useful for managing content for a Solana-based
application, as it would allow teams to define the types of content and data that they need to store
and manage.
Sanity.io also provides a rich set of tools for working with and organizing content, including a
powerful query language and a real-time content editor. These tools could be useful for managing
content for a Solana-based application, as they would allow teams to easily create, edit, and
organize their content.
Overall, while Sanity.io is not specifically designed for managing a Solana network, it could
potentially be used in conjunction with a Solana-based application to manage content for the
application. Its flexible data model and powerful content management tools make it a useful tool
for teams looking to manage
